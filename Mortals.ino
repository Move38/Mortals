/*
 * Mortals for Blinks
 * 
 *  Setup: 2 player game. Tiles die slowly over time, all at the same rate. 
 *  Moving a single tile to a new place allows it to suck life from 
 *  surrounding tiles, friend or foe.
 *  
 *  Blinks start with 60 seconds of life
 *  
 *  When a tile is moved alone, it sucks 5 seconds of health from each one of
 *  its newly found neighbors. A non-moved neighbor with a new neighbor looses 5 seconds
 *  and animates in the direction it lost the life (i.e. where the neighbor showed up)
 *  
 *   Tiles resets health to full when triple press occurs
 *
 *    States for game piece.
 *    Alive/Dead
 *    Team
 *    Attack, Injured
 *
 *  Technical Details:
 *  A long press on the tile changes the color of the tile for prototyping (switch state 1 or 2)
 *
 *
