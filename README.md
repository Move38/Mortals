This post apocalyptic battle for resources leaves the most greedy survivors in increasingly dire conditions. Two rival covens steal life from one another until only a single Mortal survives.

## SETUP
All tiles start in the initial cluster formation (see Fig. 2), divided evenly with one player’s group on one side of the cluster, and the second player’s group on the other..

  _Long-press_ changes the player color (4 possible player colors)
  _Double-click_ resets the game for all connected tiles. 
  _Single-click_ starts the game for all connected tiles

The moment the game starts, all tiles begin their slow descent (losing health/time). 
 
## GAMEPLAY
Each tile starts with 60 seconds of life. The only way to extend a tile’s life (max. 90 seconds) is to steal seconds from other tiles.

Players take turns sliding any tile or tiles from an outer location of the cluster to a new location in the cluster. It is important to note that any single tile that is removed from the cluster goes into ‘attack’ mode; when it rejoins the cluster, it will steal 5 seconds from each of the surrounding tiles. Players should keep this in mind should they choose to move their opponent’s tile. Fracturing the cluster to move several tiles at once is a legal move, as long as the fracture results in two smaller clusters and is recombined into a single cluster. 

When a tile has no life remaining, it becomes a ‘zombie’ tile that accelerates the death of surrounding tiles. Use this to your advantage — the more zombies present, the faster their neighbors decline. (1 zombie = 2x death rate, 2 zombies = 3x death rate)
 
## WIN CONDITION

Have the last living tile.
